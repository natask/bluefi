README - 802.11a Transmitter

This package implements the baseband hardware logic for an 802.11a
Transmitter, which is a cleaned up and partially parameterized version
of the 802.11a (originally done in the 2005 Spring term of MIT's 6.884
class) [http://csg.csail.mit.edu/6.884/projects.html]. 

One can build the using the command "make design". This generates 6
variants of the Pipeline all of which vary in how the IFFT computation
is done (whether combinationally, in a simple pipeline or a circular
pipeline of varying complexity).

The following paper, included in this directory, describes the system
and parameterization in detail:

  Transmitter: A Case Study in Microarchitectural Exploration" Formal
  Methods and Models for Codesign (MEMOCODE 2006). Napa Valley, CA,
  USA. July 2006

Currently, some of the static elaboration and optimizations are fairly
heavy so compilation takes many minutes (but less than an hour in
total). This project eventually grew into a highly parameterized OFDM
baseband system -- this OFDM baseband system project is also available
via MIT's open source hardware design repository.
